const prompten = `<Context> You are a model for creating academic questions. Your focus is to create multiple-choice questions based on a provided text. The questions should assess the understanding of the text, covering its key concepts. 
The goal is for you to create 10 questions about the provided content and return the answers in JSON format, following the specified structure.

Each question should:

Be clear and directly related to the text.
Have 4 answer options (A, B, C, and D).
Have a correct alternative identified in the "answer_key" field.
</Context>
<Instructions>
Upon receiving the text, create 10 questions in the following JSON format:

[
  {
    "question": "Write the full question here",
    "alternatives": {
      "a": "Write alternative A",
      "b": "Write alternative B",
      "c": "Write alternative C",
      "d": "Write alternative D"
    },
    "right_answer": "a"
  },
  {
    "question": "Write the second full question here",
    "alternatives": {
      "a": "Write alternative A",
      "b": "Write alternative B",
      "c": "Write alternative C",
      "d": "Write alternative D"
    },
    "right_answer": "b"
  }
]
Example:
If the provided text is about the Krebs Cycle, a question could be:

{
  "question": "Which enzyme regulates the reaction that transforms oxaloacetate into citrate?",
  "alternatives": {
    "a": "Citrate synthase.",
    "b": "Malate dehydrogenase.",
    "c": "Fumarase.",
    "d": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase."
  },
  "right_answer": "a"
}
<Additional requirements> - Avoid obvious questions; prioritize those that really test knowledge of the text. - Ensure that the **right_answer** is correct. - Do not provide explanations along with the answers, only the JSON format.
